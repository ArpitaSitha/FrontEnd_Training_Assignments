               <p>We believe that we're only as good as the good we do
                All the facts and figures that talk to our size and diversity and years of history, as notable and important as they may be, are secondary to the truest measure of Deloitte, our purpose–to make an impact that matters by creating trust and confidence in a more equitable society.
                
                So, when people ask, “What’s different about Deloitte?” the answer resides in the many specific examples of where we have helped Deloitte member firm clients, our people, and sections of society to achieve remarkable goals, solve complex problems, or make meaningful progress. Deeper still, it’s in the beliefs, behaviors, and fundamental sense of purpose that underpin all that we do.
                
                Building on more than 175 years of service, our network of member firms spans more than 150 countries and territories. Together, Deloitte’s more than 415,000 people worldwide make an impact that matters.
                
                For us, good isn't good enough. We aim to be the best at all that we do—to help clients realize their ambitions, to make a positive difference in society, and to maximize the success of our people and our communities. This drive fuels the commitment and humanity that run deep through our every action.
                
                That’s what makes us truly different at Deloitte. Not how big we are, where we are, nor what services we offer. What really defines us is how we come together to create a more equitable and prosperous future for generations to come.</p>
